Student Record Management System
A mini project developed in **C++** for managing student records in academic institutions. This system enables easy management of student information such as personal details, academic performance, and enrolled courses, ensuring efficient and accurate record-keeping.
Project Overview
The **Student Record Management System** allows administrators to:
- Add new student records
- Search students by roll number, first name, or course ID
- Update existing student details
- Delete records from the database
- Count the total number of students

This system is designed for console-based interaction and demonstrates core C++ programming concepts like structures, arrays, and conditional logic.
Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++
- **IDE/Compiler:** Code::Blocks, GCC, MinGW
- **Database (optional for enhancements):** MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite (for future scope)
- **Platform:** Windows/Linux
Features
